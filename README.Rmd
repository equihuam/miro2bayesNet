# miro2bayes

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this library is to interact with a **Miro** board that has been set up to represent a Bayesian network. We assumed that in **Miro**, *sticky notes* represent the network's *nodes*, and *connectors* represent *arcs* suggesting a causal/influence link. Sticky notes should have text describing the node, and a single *tag*, indicating the name of the corresponding *variable in the database*. With this library, you will be able to gather the attributes to lay out the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of the network, which has been collaboratively portrayed in **Miro**. With all the basic data brought into *R*, you can formally process a DAG. This includes the ability to further process and train the model in *R*, and even in other platforms like `bnlearn` in *R*, or the various options available in *Python* or in dedicated applications like *Netica*. There are functions in this library to do so.


## Installation

You can install the development version of `miro2bayes` like so:

``` {r loading, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("equihuam/miro2bayesNet")
```

## Example

To interact with **Miro** you need your credentials, which can be obtained following [this Quickstart directions for your *first REST API call*](https://developers.miro.com/docs/rest-api-build-your-first-hello-world-app?utm_source=your_apps). The `miro2bayes` library uses `keyring` library to keep your credentials safe; so, you will need to register your credentials in your local machine with the function `key_set(service="identifier-you-like", username = "user-name-you-like")` as [described here](https://rdrr.io/cran/keyring/man/key_get.html). Both *service* and *username* are required, respectively, as *servMiro* and *user* parameters, to get access to **Miro** with the function `datosMiro` as explained below.

This is a basic example which shows you how to get Bayesian network data from **Miro**:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
miro_data <- datosMiro(servMiro = "miro", user = "your-miro-token", boad_id = "your-board-id")
miro_data
```

If you need to find the *board id* of interest, you could use the function `miroBoards`. This function queries **Miro** with the credentials provided and returns a `tibble` with the data describing the boards available to that user.

```{r boards, eval=FALSE}
miro_boards <- miroBoards(servMiro = "miro", user = "your-miro-token")
miro_boards[, c("name", "id")]

```

## Typical Use Cycle

<img align="right" height="200px" src="figures/use cycle.png"> 

A typical cycle of use would be as illustrated in the Figure. This way you shall have a collection of implied conditional independence relations to discuss the **DAG** structure. By critical analysis of the **DAG** you should go back to **Miro** to solve inconsistencies or further develop the intended *causal proposition*.

```{r example2, eval=FALSE}
miro_data <- datosMiro(servMiro = "miro", user = "your-miro-token")
miro_DAG <-  prepara_DAG(nods = miro_data$nodos, arcs = miro_data$arcos)
cat(indepCond)
```
A quick check of the network recovered from **Miro** can be produced with the function `miro_validar`. The check shows whether the network is indeed a *DAG* (no cycles present!) and a few numbers describing what was found in **Miro**: number of nodes, identified variable names, the status of links, and so for.

```{r check, eval=FALSE}
check_data <- miro_validar(variables = datos_miro$nodes, arcs = datos_miro$arcs))
t(check_data)
```

Once a satisfactory Bayesian network has been produced, the function **red2DNE** is used to produce a *.DNE* file that can be used in Netica and other dedicated Bayesian network software for training, analysis and prediction.

```{r eval=FALSE}
miro_data <- datosMiro(servMiro = "miro", user = "your-miro-token")

data_DNE <- red2DNE(frames_data = miro_data$marcos, 
                    variables= miro_data$nodos, 
                    arcs = miro_data$arcos)
```
Another option is to feed **Miro** data into `bnlearn` with the function `miro2bnlearn`. Which is done as follows.

```{r eval=FALSE}
netMiro_bn <- miro2bnlearn(nodes = datos_miro$nodes, arcs = datos_miro$arcs)
```
